    "title: Discovering Continuations with Typed Holes\n",

    "I've been trying to wrap my head around continuations for a while. I was reading [David Luposchainsky's excellent article](https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/cont_monad.md) on them and playing with his definitions in an IHaskell notebook when I found that typed holes are an excellent hammer to attack this particular nail with.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't encountered them before, [typed holes](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Typed_holes) are a feature where you put one or more variables starting with `_` on the right hand side of a definition to get GHC to tell you the type of the value that fits in that hole, and you can narrow the hole as necessary to get the type of a subexpression until you have enough information to complete the definition. I like to think of this as a way of collaboratively filling in a definition with the compiler, instead of my usual approach which is to write a definition, listen carefully to GHC's complaints, and amend my definition accordingly. Typed holes are fully supported by GHCi and the full suite of editor integrations, but I personally find the edit/reload/squint cycle more tedious than coming up with the definition in IHaskell and then moving it to a module and adding type signatures after I'm satisfied that it works.\n",

    "IHaskell has HLint integration and will suggest corrections for my intermediate cells unless I turn that off:"

    "This defines a type `Cont` with an infix constructor `>>-` (that looks suspiciously similar to `>>=`) that takes a function from `a` to `r` and provides an `r`. One intuition for what this means is that a value of this type knows about an `a` but for whatever reason refuses to be upfront about it and demands to know what you're going to do with it and then does it for you, providing you with a final result `r`. Another intuition is that this is a generalisation of callbacks: a value of this type expects a callback to utilise the `a`. Anyway, on to my favourite part of working with mysterious data types: defining `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` instances for them! If you've done this before, you'll know that these typeclasses have certain laws that their instances are meant to obey, and it turns out that this type is polymorphic enough that we can just follow the typed holes and the resulting definitions will be lawful. You don't have to take my word for it and should verify this for yourself, but I won't be discussing the laws here. Let's begin!"
