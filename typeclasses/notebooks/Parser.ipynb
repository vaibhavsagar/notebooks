    "Monadic parsing in Haskell is what sold me on all three. Before Haskell my experiences with parsing had involved buggy regexes for lexers and wrangling tools like `bison` and `flex`, and although I'd heard that Haskell was good for parsing I couldn't see how this could be the case when I couldn't find any robust regex libraries! An aside in some documentation pointed me to Attoparsec and when I saw the [example RFC2616 parser](https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/blob/master/examples/RFC2616.hs) it seemed like a magic trick. How could it be so small? After a few weeks of trying it myself I was convinced. This was the first application of monads I encountered that actually made my life simpler, and I started to realise that there was more to monads than smugness and being inaccessible to newcomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "['Monadic Parsing in Haskell'](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf) laid the groundwork for libraries like Attoparsec, and after using these libraries for a while I found it quite approachable. Although it was published in 1998 (almost 20 years ago!) it has aged gracefully and the code samples will run with almost no changes. However, the state of the art has advanced since then and I think the use of modern Haskell can make this material simpler to follow and implement. I'm assuming you have the original paper nearby to compare this with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first change I want to make is the type definition. The paper uses the type\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "newtype Parser a = Parser (String -> [(a,String)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and although this is a famous enough definition that it has [its own rhyme](http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/seuss.html), I think the flexibility of lists is unnecessary. The authors don't use it, and instead define a 'deterministic choice' operator that gives at most one result and use that everywhere instead. There is already a perfectly good datatype in Haskell for this, `Maybe`, so I'll use that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "newtype Parser a = Parser (String -> Maybe (a, String))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Renaming `String` to `s` and `Maybe` to `m` reveals a more interesting pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "newtype Parser s m a = Parser (s -> m (a, s))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is [`StateT`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers/docs/Control-Monad-Trans-State-Strict.html#t:StateT)! Recognising this pattern makes instance definitions much easier, so much easier in fact that GHC can do it for us automatically with `-XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving`! For completeness I will resist the temptation to do this, but you can try it yourself with\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}\n",
    "newtype Parser a = Parser (StateT String Maybe a) deriving (Functor, Applicative, Alternative, Monad)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second change is also for completeness: the authors jump straight into the `Monad` instance without defining `Functor` and `Applicative` first. To be fair, the `Applicative` abstraction hadn't been discovered yet, and this is also the reason why the authors define `mzero` and `mplus` (which they call `(++)`) instead of `Alternative`. Because of our `Maybe` change, I'll be able to get away with defining just `Alternative` and won't need to bother with their `(++)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I'll try to avoid do-notation where possible in favour of a more Applicative style using e.g. `<*>` because a lot of the benefits of these parsers don't require it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin!"
